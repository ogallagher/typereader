				<h2>
					Background
				</h2>
				
				<p class="legible">
					<strong>Keystroke dynamics</strong> is the analysis of typing rhythm, which can be used to 
					<strong>identify</strong> typers, and then <strong>recognize</strong> them later on. It can 
					be thought of as a kind of biometric with potential for use as a credential, with a number of
					<strong>advantages</strong> and <strong>drawbacks</strong>.
				</p>
				
				<p class="legible">
					In favor of keystroke signature is that the user does not have to <strong>memorize</strong> a password. 
					This is an advantage shared by all biometric credential systems. In fact, depending on the
					implementation, a keystroke authenticator might allow the user to type
					anything as long as if fits certain criteria (minimum length, for example). Another advantage
					of keystroke signature is the difficulty someone would have to <strong>spoof</strong> it (duplicate another
					user's signature by typing in the same fasion). Additionally, doing the authentication only
					requires minimal <strong>equipment</strong> that the user have access to a way of typing, 
					which is an essential component of almost any computational device.
				</p>
				
				<p class="legible">
					However, there also a number drawbacks to keystroke dynamics that help explain why it 
					is <strong>not</strong> generally used for authentication yet. <strong>Firstly,</strong> there will be a
					formidable number of <strong>"goats"</strong> if the user base grows too large; very young
					and very old users would likely have very <strong>inconsistent</strong> keystroke patterns,
					much in the same way that a child might change their handwritten signature multiple times
					as they mature their handwriting, or that an older user might have difficulty with fine
					motor skills. And that doesn't even consider users without hands or adequate use of
					their hands to be able to type. <strong>Secondly,</strong> it may be difficult to spoof a keystroke
					signature, but certainly <strong>not impossible</strong>. An attacker could use a
					keystroke logger or ask the victim to type something and then analyze the keystrokes to
					obtain an accurate copy of that victim's signature. It would then be a matter of <strong>reproducing</strong>
					those keystrokes (physically or through software) at the authenticator terminal for
					the attacker to succeed. <strong>Thirdly,</strong> as with all biometrics, keystroke
					signature ideally is a <strong>"what you are"</strong> credential, meaning it is 
					fixed and <strong>permanent</strong> for a given person. The implications of this mean that if that signature
					is compromised, then that user has no way of getting a new one.
				</p>
				
				<p class="legible">
					<strong>Fourthly,</strong> the accuracy of keystroke authentication systems (aka. 
					keystroke dynamics anomaly detectors) has not reached an acceptable minimum.
					The European standards for access control systems as published by <strong>CENELEC</strong> (EN-50133-1)
					require that (note that <strong>"positive"</strong> means the test keystrokes are an anomaly, as in they
					<strong>do not match</strong> the user's keystroke signature they're trying to authenticate against, and
					<strong>"negative"</strong> means that the test keystrokes <strong> do match</strong> the signature they're being
					tested against):
					
					<ol>
						<li>
							The false negative rate (FNR, fraud error) should be less than 0.001%;<br><strong>FNR &lt; 0.00001</strong>
						</li>
						<li>
							The false positive rate (FPR, insult error) should be less than 1%;<br><strong>FPR &lt; 0.01</strong>
						</li>
					</ol>

				<h2>
					Algorithm Evaluation Methodology
				</h2>
				
				<p class="legible">
					There have been many attempts to create algorithms that can quickly and accurately create a 
					keystroke signature for users. In the next section are a list of some that were thoroughly tested and
					evaluated against each other in 
					<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~maxion/pubs/KillourhyMaxion09.pdf">this paper by K. Kollourhy and R. Maxion</a>.
				</p>
				
				<p class="legible">
					They're research was heavily focused on comparison and being able to objectively determine which of the
					anomaly detection algorithms that they analyzed was the <strong>best</strong>. To do so, they needed to
					standardize the process. They started by only considering algorithms that created a keystroke signature
					from a password (as opposed to a sentence, paragraph, etc). A major hurdle that prevented them from 
					simply comparing the results of past experiments was the <strong>variety</strong> between
					each; different experiments used different feature sets, password lengths, password reps (number of
					repetitions during training needed to create the user's signature), user and time outlier filtering,
					number of attempts allowed during authentication, static vs. dynamic keystroke signatures, and
					thresholds for positive/negative classification, among other factors. Kollourhy and Maxion did their 
					algorithm comparison by implementing each and doing their own tests, controlling all of these variables:
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							The <strong>same</strong> 51 users/participants were used for identification/training and testing.
						</li>
						<li>
							Each user typed <strong>400 reps</strong> of a password to create their signature, in 8 sessions, each spaced
							24 hours apart, each containing 50 correct typings of the password.
						</li>
						<li>
							One password was used for all users: <strong>".tie5Roanl"</strong>, being a typical representation 
							of strong a password (having more than 7 chars, upper and lower case, letters, punctuation).
						</li>
						<li>
							All users used the same keyboard and computer.
						</li>
						<li>
							They collected the key event types (press, release), timestamps, and key names for each sample, 
							including the ENTER key. These features were then compiled into a timing vector, being a point
							in p-space, where each feature was an axis, and where a keystroke signature was made up of a
							cloud of these sample points in p-space.
						</li>
					</ul>

				</div>
				
				<p class="legible">
					To determine the anomaly detection algorithm with the best accuracy they calculated the
					<strong>Receiver Operating Characteristic</strong>, or <strong>ROC</strong> of each. This value is
					determined by first testing the algorithm against a sample of imposter and legitimate password
					entries, and calculating the
					<strong>True Positive Rate (TPR)</strong> and
					<strong>False Positive Rate (FPR)</strong> along a set of thresholds, to test the trade-off
					between detecting imposters (TPR) and rejecting legitimates (FPR). The point corresponding to each
					threshold is plotted in a graph, as seen in <a href="#roc-chart">Figure 1</a>.
				</p>

				<p class="legible subtitle">
					X/Y = 0/1 = 0.00
				</p>
				<p class="legible">
					As can be seen in the example ROC
					graph, the best threshold is close to the point marked <strong>equal-error</strong>. This is a
					threshold technique that essentially makes X equal to Y in the ROC graph.
				</p>

					Their research included many algorithms (14), but I've chosen to compare my favorites in the next
					section, curated according to difference in <strong>approach</strong> and <strong>accuracy</strong>

						This is the most basic algorithm for anomaly detection. Given an entry is a typed password with

						data for determining a keystroke signature is a cloud of these points. The center of this
						cloud is the signature, <strong>X</strong>. Authentication (or anomaly detection) consists of

					Objectives and Approach for Typereader
				</h2>
				
				<p class="legible">
					As a final step in this investigation I wanted to try making my <strong>own</strong> keystroke
					authentication system: <strong>Typereader</strong>. Ideally, I could then compare my own attempt
					with the results listed above. The issue is that doing an experiment under the same conditions
					as those in the Kollourhy and Maxion study is not possible for me: I'm not looking for <strong>50</strong>
					test subjects, each to enter a password <strong>400</strong> times to create their signatures, and then
					authenticating and measuring the ROC scores for each threshold.
				</p>
				
				<p class="legible">
					What I've decided to do instead is, informed by the results of these experiments I have cited
					and studied, to create my own authentication system <strong>without</strong> worring about evaluation against
					a baseline or testing it properly. I'll then publish it here for the reader to do play with,
					critique, and perhaps extend or remix. With that in mind, here's my approach:
				</p>
				
				<ul class="legible">
					<li>
						Define a user's keystroke signature by having them enter a series of <strong>words</strong> that come
						to mind according to a two-letter prompt. The prompt assures that the signature definition
						includes at least <strong>n</strong> samples of each feature and <strong>f</strong> features,
						and the liberty for the user to choose their own words allows them to type things they have more practice
						typing, and for which they likely have a more <strong>unique</strong> typing rhythm.
					</li>
					<li>
						A feature in a typed entry is the elapsed from from the press of key <strong>k</strong>
						to the press of key <strong>k+1</strong>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Instead of each feature being associated with a character position in the typed password,
						features are associated with <strong>2-char sequences</strong> (ex: a->a, a->b, ... z->z).
					</li>
					<li>
						Valid keys for a feature are the <strong>alphanumeric</strong> keys, <strong>punctuation</strong>
						keys, and <strong>SHIFT</strong> key. Whitespace will not be allowed, as well as special
						ALT characters (greek letters, symbols, etc).
					</li>
					<li>
						Once a user's signature is defined and associated with a username, subsequent attempts to
						authenticate against that keystroke signature will use the <a href="#manhattan">Scaled Manhattan</a>
						algorithm as described above. Since I will not test to find a good threshold and don't want to
						pick one arbitrarily, Typereader will return the <strong>anomaly score</strong> of the test entry
						against the signature (high=imposter, low=legitimate). This score won't mean anything on its own,
						but it can be used <strong>relative</strong> to other logins for comparison.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			
			<div id="conclusion" class="section">
				<h2>
					Conclusion and Usage Notes
				</h2>
				
				<p class="legible">
					In the end I did manage to create a keystroke authentication system with <strong>Typereader</strong>,
					using the Manhattan algorithm and controlling for feature standard deviation. I also added a division by
					the number of features, to normalize between different signatures possibly having different numbers
					of features. Otherwise, since manhattan distance between vectors increases with each additional component,
					signatures with higher numbers of features would require much higher thresholds.
				</p>
				
				<p class="legible">
					Though I've not been able to test the effectiveness of this authenticator, I'm fairly certain it's
					ROC score and other measures of accuracy would be pretty <strong>low</strong>. Even though I used 
					essentially the same <strong>algorithm</strong> as the best anomaly detector from the paper I cited,
					there are a number of other factors that I changed. The data collection phase when determining a new
					user's keystroke signature is probably more prone to <strong>outlier data</strong>, since the user has
					complete freedom to choose the word contexts in which those keystrokes appear. The sampling method is
					also much quicker and leads to less reliable feature statistics (Typereader only samples each feature
					5 times, though this can be changed). Lastly, the features themselves are essentially
					<strong>contextless</strong> because they only correspond to the time difference between two consecutive
					keys, and not a particular position in a password. This weakness, leading to further variability and
					lower true positive rates, could be much improved by making features correspond to groups of three
					or four characters instead of just two. For example:
					
					<p class="subtitle">"ef" = 80ms</p>
					
					could become
					
					<p class="subtitle">"cdef" = 80ms</p>
					
					where the additional keys give more context and consistency in the data collection phase, but the
					associated time lapse still refers to the time between the <strong>e</strong> and <strong>f</strong>
					keys.
				</p>
				
				<p class="legible">
					Here's a list of some parameters that can be changed in <strong>typereader.js</strong> to modify
					how keystroke signatures are created:
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>FAV_WORDS</strong><br>
							This determines how many initial entries are required of the user before features are picked
							for the final signature.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>FEATURE_SAMPLE_SIZE</strong><br>
							How many samples of a feature (character combination and time elapsed) are taken before a
							signature can calculate the mean and standard deviation.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>SIGNATURE_SIZE</strong><br>
							How many different features are included in a signature. Since my manhattan algorithm divides
							the anomaly score by the number of features, this should prevent from theoretically having to
							change thresholds for different signature sizes.
						</li>
					</ul>
